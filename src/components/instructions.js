        The purpose of this exercise is to get to know you a little better as a
        software developer. At Nav, we are not fans of whiteboard coding
        exercises and programming trivia questions. We want to know how you will
        perform on a real task our team takes on day-to-day. This involves
        writing some code, finishing a feature and discussing it with your peers.

      <Header>Part 1: The Challenge</Header>
      <Copy>
        Here's what you'll do:

        <ul>
          <li>
            On the next page, you'll see an example of an interactive card.
            Build your own version of it.
          </li>
          <li>
            Feel free to stick to the visual styles we have in place or get
            creative and add your own flair ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥. It's important that you implement
            the feature in full, so pay close attention to the details.
          </li>
          <li>
            We have two technical requirements. <strong>1.</strong> Your UI
            should be populated using a JSON data structure. <strong>2.</strong>
            {' '}Use React for UI components.
          </li>
          <li>
            Push your solution to Github or send over a .zip when you're done.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </Copy>

      <Header>Part 2: Discuss with Team</Header>
      <Copy>
        You will discuss your code and explain your decisions to a small group of
        developers and stakeholders at Nav. The format is modeled after
        the way we conduct pairing sessions and is meant to give you a glimpse
        into the way we work. We are SUPER friendly and it will be a fun
        conversation.
